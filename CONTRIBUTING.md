Tips
------------

 - This project is implemented in Javascript for Node JS v4 (ES6). Make sure you have knowledge of this environment before making pull request with changes in the source code.
 - When you write a commit name, describe what your commit does. Do not use commit names like `Update main.js` or `Changes`.
 - Use `npm test` to check your code style and find errors.
 - Test your changes before commiting.
 - For new features or bugs, open an issue first, before making any pull request. Maybe it is not necesary, it is wrong or i'm already implementing it.
